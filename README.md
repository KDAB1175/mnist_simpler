# mnist_simpler
Basic ML classifier on MNIST dataset. Build with Python and Pytorch

## Overview and specs
Idea behind this was to make the model more like a brain, not all nodes are connected and some might go above a layer. This was cardinally stupid idea as it bypasses the needed itterations needed for it to work, also it is like 20k times  slower. In the end not  even the brain works like this, you just have to imagine a different structure, one where some nodes or even layers branch out and reconnect layer on in the model. That will be chaos mk2.
